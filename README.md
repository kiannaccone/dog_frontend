# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# Reason for the project:
    This project was built in order to apply and showcase the skills we have learned and developed during our phase three training at the Software Engineering Live class - FlatIron Bootcamp (class of 09/21). These skills major in our use of JavaScript and React to manipulate and change the DOM, and CSS to design webpages. To create a backend API for our application, we utilized Sinatra to create CRUD responses, Activerecord to make SQL commands, and Ruby to create classes and endpoints.
# Project Description:
    Dog Heist's is a site for users who need a special job done. It allows users to create their own heist by naming the heist and who is the creator of the heist. From there, you are navigated to a page; beware, these dogs are bad to the bone. To see their more information on one dog click on their image to view their profile. If they look like the right dog to you, you can select a role for them, their treat payout, which heist they belong to, and finally add them to the heist. Lastly, to see which dogs are in which heist you can view the Heist's page which gives all the heists or can delete an entire heist.
# Learnings and Struggles:
    This project challenged us to connect frontend and backend, but was rewarding to see the two work together and why you want your website to be backend heavy. During this project, we gathered more experience handling and manipulating DOM elements, building relations with our tables, and making CRUD actions. This project challenged and showed us the importance of project planning especially when it comes to tables and the use of join tables. Overall, it was a fun project with a fun concept that furthered our developer skills.
# Acknowledgments:
  We used numerous resources both from our curriculum and those available for free online. These allowed us to expand our knowledge and practice many new skills.
